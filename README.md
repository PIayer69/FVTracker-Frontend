# PV Statistics Tracker
App designed for PV users, who are interested how their investment is doing. My second Rest Framework and ReactJS project, on which I want to keep working till it becomes client-ready app. 

## Things that are working

- Calculation of basics stuff (autoconsumption, consumption, balance)
- Adding and editing posts (deleting coming soon)

## Things to be done

- Fix how posts are added and edited (recalculating is not working as intended)
- User settings page
- User authentication, and user based posts
- In future I'm planing on adding charts
- Nicer looking login and register page
- Better CSS (site is looking pretty ugly right now)
